		<p class="red-text">My name is Matt and I am a participant in the 2017 UNC Coding Bootcamp. Web Development and coding in general is gaining more importance in the world and I figured now is as good a time as ever to start learning. I am feeling the entire spectrum of emotion by taking this class and expect to grow a lot, both personally and professionally.</p>
